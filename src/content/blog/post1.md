# **Project Overview:**

- Nov 2022 - Present

# **Project Summary:**
Servismedicamp was born as a necessary service for the migrant community, in need of specialized health services upon returning to their community. It also serves the relatives of migrants in the country, who are often exposed and forgotten due to a lack of institutions providing these services. The project is based on a fund created by the users themselves to finance their care.

# **Management and Development:**
- Conducted contract negotiations, developed SRS, and managed budget negotiations.
- Implemented AgilePM for efficient and strategic project planning and execution.
- Assigned phase-based tasks initially through Trello, then seamlessly migrated the entire project to Jira, achieving work branch automation via Jira+GitHub integration.
- Oversaw the negotiation of project phases and mediated issues, using Scrum as the agile methodology, culminating in the successful deployment of the application on the Play Store.
